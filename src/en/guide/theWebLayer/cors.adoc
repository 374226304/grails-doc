Spring Boot provides CORS support out of the box, but it is difficult to configure in a Grails application due to the way UrlMappings are used instead of annotations that define URLs. Starting with Grails 3.2.1, we have added a way to configure CORS that makes sense in a Grails application.

Once enabled, the default setting is "wide open".

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
grails:
    cors:
        enabled: true
----

That will produce a mapping to all urls `/**` with:

[width="40%"]
|=======
|allowedOrigins |`['*']`
|allowedMethods |`['*']`
|allowedHeaders |`['*']`
|exposedHeaders |`null`
|maxAge         |`1800`
|allowCredentials |true
|=======

Some of these settings come directly from Spring Boot and can change in future versions. See {springapi}/org/springframework/web/cors/CorsConfiguration.html#applyPermitDefaultValues[Spring CORS Configuration Documentation]

All of those settings can be easily overridden.

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
grails:
    cors:
        enabled: true
        allowedOrigins:
            - http://localhost:5000
----

In the example above, the `allowedOrigins` setting will replace `[*]`.

You can also configure different URLs.

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
grails:
    cors:
        enabled: true
        allowedHeaders:
            - Content-Type
        mappings:
            /api/**:
                allowedOrigins:
                    - http://localhost:5000
                # Other configurations not specified default to the global config
----

WARNING: Specifying at least one mapping will disable the creation of the global mapping (`/**`). If you wish to keep that setting, you should specify it along with your other mappings.

The settings above will produce a single mapping of `/api/**` with the following settings:

[width="40%"]
|=======
|allowedOrigins |`['http://localhost:5000']`
|allowedMethods |`['*']`
|allowedHeaders |`['Content-Type']`
|exposedHeaders |`null`
|maxAge         |`1800`
|allowCredentials |true
|=======

If you don't wish to override any of the default settings, but only want to specify URLs, you can do so like this example:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
grails:
    cors:
        enabled: true
        mappings:
            /api/**: inherit
----
